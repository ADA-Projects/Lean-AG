A formalization project in **Lean 4** of selected results from Ulrich G√∂rtz and Torsten Wedhorn's *"Algebraic Geometry I"* (2nd Edition). This repository serves as a portfolio demonstration of formal mathematics and proof verification capabilities in modern algebraic geometry.

## üéØ Project Overview

This is a **learning project** to develop expertise in formalizing advanced algebraic geometry using Lean 4. The ultimate goal is to work toward significant theorems like **B√©zout's theorem**, **Zariski's Main Theorem**, or other major results in algebraic geometry.

Currently, I'm building foundational infrastructure by formalizing basic results from G√∂rtz-Wedhorn's textbook, starting with **Chapter 5: Schemes** and dimension theory. While these preliminary results (like Lemma 5.7) require substantial code due to the complexity of formalization, they're stepping stones toward the real mathematical milestones.

### üìö Reference & Methodology

- **Primary Source**: Ulrich G√∂rtz and Torsten Wedhorn, *"Algebraic Geometry I"*, 2nd Edition
- **Current Phase**: Foundational results on topological Krull dimension and scheme theory
- **Long-term Goals**: Major theorems like B√©zout's theorem, Zariski's Main Theorem, or cohomological results
- **Purpose**: Personal learning project to master Lean 4 formalization techniques in algebraic geometry

### ‚ú® Current Progress

**Foundation Building (Chapter 5):**
- **Lemma 5.7**: Complete formalization of topological Krull dimension properties
- **Subspace dimension inequality**: `dim(Y) ‚â§ dim(X)` for subspaces
- **Proper closed subset dimension**: Strict inequality for proper closed subsets
- **Open cover dimension formula**: `dim(X) = sup{dim(U_i) : U_i open cover}`
- **Irreducible components dimension**: `dim(X) = sup{dim(Y) : Y irreducible component}`
- **Scheme dimension characterization**: Connection between topological and ring-theoretic dimensions

**Learning Outcomes So Far:**
- **~1350 lines** of Lean 4 code (substantial due to formalization complexity, not mathematical depth)
- **Infrastructure development**: Building the foundation needed for serious algebraic geometry
- **Technique mastery**: Advanced proof techniques in topological spaces, order theory, and categorical constructions
- **Understanding the gap**: Appreciating the difference between mathematical intuition and formal verification

## üèóÔ∏è Formalized Theorems

### Current Foundation: Lemma 5.7 (G√∂rtz-Wedhorn)

This **foundational lemma** establishes basic properties of topological Krull dimension. While not a deep result in algebraic geometry, its formalization demonstrates the infrastructure needed for serious theorems:

```lean
theorem thm_scheme_dim :
  (‚àÄ (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] (Y : Set X),
    topologicalKrullDim Y ‚â§ topologicalKrullDim X) ‚àß
  (‚àÄ (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] (Y : Set X),
    IsIrreducible (Set.univ : Set X) ‚Üí
    topologicalKrullDim X ‚â† ‚ä§ ‚Üí
    IsClosed Y ‚Üí Y ‚äÇ Set.univ ‚Üí Y.Nonempty ‚Üí
    topologicalKrullDim Y < topologicalKrullDim X) ‚àß
  (‚àÄ (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] (Œπ : Type*) (U : Œπ ‚Üí Set X),
    (‚àÄ i, IsOpen (U i)) ‚Üí (‚ãÉ i, U i = Set.univ) ‚Üí
    topologicalKrullDim X = ‚®Ü i, topologicalKrullDim (U i)) ‚àß
  (‚àÄ (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X],
    topologicalKrullDim X = ‚®Ü (Y ‚àà irreducibleComponents X), topologicalKrullDim Y) ‚àß
  (‚àÄ (X : Scheme), schemeDim X = ‚®Ü x : X, ringKrullDim (X.presheaf.stalk x))
```

## üöÄ Learning Roadmap

This project is building toward major algebraic geometry theorems through systematic foundation building:

### Near-term (Building Infrastructure)
1. **Complete Chapter 5**: Finish basic scheme theory and morphism properties
2. **Geometric Constructions**: Projective spaces, blow-ups, and basic varieties
3. **Intersection Theory Foundations**: Cycles, divisors, and intersection products

### Medium-term (Substantial Results)
4. **B√©zout's Theorem**: Intersection multiplicities and degree bounds
5. **Zariski's Main Theorem**: Proper morphisms and normalizations
6. **Cohomology Theory**: Sheaf cohomology and vanishing theorems

### Long-term (Deep Theorems)
7. **Riemann-Roch**: For curves and surfaces
8. **Resolution of Singularities**: In characteristic zero
9. **Advanced Topics**: √âtale cohomology, scheme theory applications

*Note: This is an ambitious learning timeline - each step involves substantial technical development.*
