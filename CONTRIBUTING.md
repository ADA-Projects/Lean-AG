# Contributing to Lean-AG

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the G√∂rtz-Wedhorn Algebraic Geometry formalization project! This is primarily a portfolio and educational project, but contributions are welcome in the following areas:

## How to Contribute

### üîß Fill Proof Gaps
- If you find `sorry` statements in proofs, you're welcome to complete them!
- Include the specific file and line number where the `sorry` occurs
- Propose your proof approach or ask for hints on the mathematical strategy


### üìö Documentation & Learning Resources
- Improve explanations in comments or documentation
- Suggest clearer proof strategies or alternative approaches
- Add references to relevant mathematical literature

### üîç Code Review & Suggestions
- Review proof techniques and suggest improvements
- Propose more elegant or efficient formulations
- Point out opportunities for generalization

### üö´ What We Don't Accept
- This is not accepting major new features or theorem additions
- The focus remains on Chapter 5 of G√∂rtz-Wedhorn for now
- Please discuss significant changes via issues before implementing

## Development Setup

1. Install [Lean 4](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html)
2. Clone the repository and run `lake exe cache get && lake build`
3. Open in VS Code with the Lean 4 extension

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue for discussion about mathematical content, alternative proof approaches, or educational use of this code.
